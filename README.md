# Image Captioning

## Description
The project is built to generate a caption for each image in the dataset which depicts the motion of each image. This is comprehensively based on **Deep Learning**, especially *Computer Vision* and *Natural Language Processing*.

*Input*: An image.

*Output*: The caption for that image.

- **Dataset**: Flickr8k
- **Pre-trained model**: Glove6B 200 (word embedding)
- **Model**: LSTM (Long Short Term Memory)

## Note
The link to the dataset is embedded in the notebook. This is a small project of mine. Hope it helps!
